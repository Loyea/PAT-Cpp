To run single C/C++ file, remember install `C/C++ Single File Execution` plugin in CLion Preferences - Plugins.

First time you open this project, go to `File` menu and click `Reload CMake Project` option to make CLion create
`cmake-build-debug` directory.

Once you add a new C/C++ file, right click on the new C/C++ file editor, click the `add executable for single c/cpp file`,
then you can run this single C/C++ file.
